Data cleaning & Transformations (Wrangling)
•	It involved combining, cleaning & presenting datasets from multiple sources to the users in a meaningful way for further analysis and modelling. Majority of the datasets were sourced from the WHO (World Health Organisation). 
•	The reason behind the choice of those datasets was to facilitate the project interests and to allow data wrangling.
A snippet of our project interests is mentioned below:
o	Effect of atmospheric pollution on human health
o	Effect of atmospheric pollution on global crop production
Tools: R, Julia, Jupyter lab & MS Excel.
